# rig-templates — the tenant-role registry

The role definitions [rig](https://github.com/heavy-duty/rig) converges onto
box-minted guests (rig#110). rig keeps the **mechanism** — convergence
discipline, the marker/manifest guards, docker, the context-file renderer
with the box#80 boilerplate; this repo keeps the **registry**: the per-role
data that used to live as case arms in rig's tree. The split exists because
the two move at different cadences — adding an agent tenant is a data PR
here, never a mechanism edit there (rig#109 is the evidence: adding kimi,
pure data, meant editing six files in a mechanism repo).

This registry publishes named releases with a changelog and a repo-local smoke
drill record. rig still pins the immutable commit a release tag names
(`RIG_TEMPLATES_PIN` in `commands/lib/templates.sh`, the `BOX_RELEASE`
discipline), bumped by ordinary reviewed rig PR — so the release makes that
commit legible without making the tag the trust boundary. A mint overrides per
run:

    RIG_TEMPLATES_DIR=<dir>    a local folder, no fetch (tests; try-before-push)
    RIG_TEMPLATES_REF=<ref>    any ref here (or in RIG_TEMPLATES_REPO), fetched
                               as an unauthenticated tarball at bootstrap time
    (neither)                  rig's in-tree pin

## Layout — one directory per role, flat, self-namespaced by suffix

The name carries the family (rig#76): `-box` for box tenants and `-server`
for machine roles. `workstation` is the one intentional suffix-less machine
role because it names the machine itself rather than a server purpose.

`template.env` grammar: blank lines, `#` comments, and `KEY="value"` —
nothing else. The value is everything between the first `="` and the line's
final `"`, so a `PATH_LINE` may carry inner quotes verbatim. It is data:
rig parses it against the allowlist and refuses anything else by key —
it is never sourced, so a definition cannot execute shell through its data
file. `CLI_SRC` may be `~/`-prefixed; rig expands that to the tenant home by
string substitution. Omit `CLI_SRC` when the install lands on the system
PATH already (codex: an npm global's path is the prefix's fact) — rig then
finds the CLI via `command -v`.

Tenant definitions default to `AGENT="yes"` and `HARDEN_SSHD="no"`, so
definitions written before those keys are unchanged. `AGENT="no"` keeps
`USER` required, refuses agent-only keys and `creds.md`, and makes
`install.sh` optional. `HARDEN_SSHD="yes"` invokes rig's shared sshd
hardening independently of whether an agent is installed.

Machine-role directories use a traits-only `template.env` allowlist:
`ROOT_DOOR`, `HOST`, and `JOIN`. They carry no `creds.md`; an `install.sh` is
optional in the schema. `crew-server` will be the first registry definition to
use that final convergence hook, installing the pinned crew host payload after
rig has completed the machine traits, tailnet join, host setup, and operators.

### The agent tenants' shared `APT_EXTRAS` base

Every agent tenant declares `APT_EXTRAS="cron gh jq"`, plus whatever its
vendor needs on top — `claude-box` carries `cron gh jq zsh`. Those three are
the hard prerequisites of crew's box-side installer, which every agent tenant
exists to run: it exits on a missing `gh` or `jq`, and a missing `crontab` is
worse, because the install completes, *reports success*, and hands the
operator an apt command for a box that will never tick.

`test/agent-apt-extras.sh` holds that base, and CI runs it on every PR beside
`rig template-lint` — never inside it, because rig owns its own schema and
must not learn one registry's conventions. Dropping a base package from any
tenant reds CI; adding a vendor package to one does not. The tenant set is
**derived** from `AGENT`, not hand-listed, so `staging-box`'s `AGENT="no"`
takes it out and a fifth vendor tenant arrives already bound to the base.

The base is this registry stating what its tenants need, not the only thing
that supplies it: rig's agent-tenant toolbelt installs `gh`, `jq` and `cron`
itself and asserts `cron.service` is enabled and active (rig#162). The
registry declaring its own requirement is what survives that toolbelt
changing.

The same check holds the boundary the withdrawn `crew-box` rests on: a tenant
gains crew's **packages** and never crew's **engine**. `~/duty` is
version-managed by crew, whose integrity verdict is built on crew being that
tree's sole writer, so no definition here installs it and no `crew-*-box`
role exists. `drill/drill.sh --crew-member` is the end-to-end evidence —
crew's installer run credential-free on a converged tenant, with cron
**armed** rather than merely installed.

## CI — rig lints every definition on every PR

rig defines what a valid template is (`rig template-lint`, shipped beside
the mint-time parser that enforces the same schema); this repo's CI runs it
on every definition on every PR, so a broken definition is refused before it
can ever reach a mint. The two gates are not redundant: CI protects the
registry, rig's bootstrap-time parse protects a mint served through
`RIG_TEMPLATES_REPO`/`_DIR` that CI never saw.

## The security trade — in bold, not a footnote

**A main-tracked rig-templates repo means every merged PR there executes as
root inside every future mint.** This is acceptable — and an improvement —
only because of three facts together: (1) it *narrows* today's surface,
where all of rig is main-tracked-as-root; (2) the repo is small,
single-purpose, and ceremony-governed with a **human merge** as the gate and
the review panel ahead of it; (3) drills pin the SHA they proved. If any of
those three weakens, the default flips to a pinned `RIG_TEMPLATES_REF`.
install.sh diffs in that repo are the highest-trust review surface in the
org — the reviewer doctrine should say so.

*2026-07-24: the flip that paragraph reserves was taken, before the
migration and by the decider* (rig#110): the default **is** pinned — a
merged PR here reaches mints only through a reviewed pin bump in rig, or
when a mint explicitly sets `RIG_TEMPLATES_REF`. The review posture stands
unchanged: **install.sh diffs here remain the highest-trust review surface**,
because the override path and every future pin bump still ship them as root.
